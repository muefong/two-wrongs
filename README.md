They say two wrongs don't make it wright.
R programming: I should remember to learn how to link Git to github. NB: Download Git and install first.
R most useful syntax until now; x <- 
e.g x <- list("a", "b")
meaning: x is a list made of two elements: a and b
"x" enter will give values of a and b just like pring will
name(x) will give their names.
m coule be a matrix e.g., m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
the matrix will appear by filling rows first and then columns 
i.e., down and then across to next column.
I can also name matrices using "dimnames". The name of a matrix is written as a list so thee command whould intervene and probably concatenation ("c" function) will be required.
dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b", "c"), c("x", "y", "z"))
